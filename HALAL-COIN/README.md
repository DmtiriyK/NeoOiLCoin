# HALAL COIN (HLLCN)

Halal Coin was created as a Shariah-compliant settlement unit, aligned with the principles of Islamic law and the requirements of transparency.
The project is registered in the relevant jurisdictions and operates within applicable regulations, without interest, speculation, or prohibited practices.
Halal Coin is designed for fair exchange, trade, and participation in the real economy, with clear terms and controlled processes.
We believe that halal finance should not only be permissible in principle, but also properly structured within the legal framework.
